## About

My name is Kora/Michii. I am a 16 year old college student that has been programming for many many many many many many many many years ^^

I code in many different languages, my main language is C# though, it is just so good <333 the other languages I code in is Javascript/Typescript, Java, C++, C, Python.

##### BTW I do not upload most of my projects to this account as the projects I make now could be used to do very no-no things to others, and also just because I dont want people using my code due to how much work I put in and I dont want anyone to just copy/steal all of it, it's kinda dumb when people just copy the entirety of someones source code and say its their own.
